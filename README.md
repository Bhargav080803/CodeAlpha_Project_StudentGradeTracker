Title: Building a Simple Grade Tracker in Java

Are you interested in learning how to track grades efficiently in Java? Check out this simple Grade Tracker program!

Overview:
This Java program allows users to input grades for a specified number of students, calculates the average grade, and identifies the highest and lowest grades entered.

Explanation:
1. Importing Libraries: We begin by importing the `Scanner` class from `java.util` package to enable user input.

2. Main Method: The `main` method serves as the entry point for our program.

3. User Input: Users are prompted to enter the number of students for whom they want to track grades.

4. Array Initialization: An array `grades` is initialized with a size equal to the number of students entered by the user.

5. Input Grades: Using a loop, the program prompts users to input grades for each student, storing them in the `grades` array.

6. Calculating Average: The program calculates the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the total number of students.

7. Finding Highest and Lowest Grades: Two variables, `highest` and `lowest`, are initialized with the first grade entered. Then, a loop iterates through the array to find the highest and lowest grades among the entered grades.

8. Displaying Results: Finally, the program prints out the average grade, highest grade, and lowest grade.

9. Closing Scanner: The `Scanner` object is closed to release system resources.

This Grade Tracker program provides a simple yet effective way to manage grades for a group of students. It's a great starting point for those looking to develop more complex grade tracking systems or expand their Java programming skills.
